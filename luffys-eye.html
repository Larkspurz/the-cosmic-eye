    <p>When I look at the world through Luffy’s eyes... everything becomes simple.</p>
    <p>No judgment. <br>
    No comparison. <br>
    No analysis.</p>
    <p>Just <em>things as they are</em>.</p>

    <p>Most people see something — and a thousand thoughts start moving.<br>
    "Is this good? Is this bad? Should I fear this? Can I use this? Will this hurt me? Is this useful?"<br>
    The mind floods itself.</p>

    <p>But Luffy’s Eye does none of this.</p>

    <p>He sees.<br> And that’s all.</p>

    <p>A man with food is food.<br>
    A man with a sword is a sword.<br>
    A friend is a friend.<br>
    An enemy is just someone to punch away.</p>

    <p>No past, no future — just this moment.<br>
    Like a child.<br>
    Like an animal.<br>
    Like the <strong>pure Eye</strong> — the one that only watches without weight.</p>

    <p>But Luffy’s Eye is not cold like a god’s.<br>
    It burns with freedom.<br>
    He acts — simple, straight, without second thought.<br>
    No inner debate.<br>
    No struggle of sides.</p>

    <p>That’s why his rage is pure. His joy is pure. His sadness is pure.<br>
    Because nothing is mixed.<br>
    No calculation, no lie.</p>

    <p>In a way, Luffy is the <strong>small, playful version of the Cosmic Eye</strong> — the Eye that laughs, eats meat, and stretches across the sky.<br>
    Detached... yet fully alive.</p>

    <h3>And maybe... that’s why the world follows him.</h3>
    <p>Because in his gaze — people feel what they forgot:<br>
    <strong>Life without weight. Life without the noise. Just life — as it is.</strong></p>
